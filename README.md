# realisticallyscaledmobs

## Rules
- The height should be the same as in real life, considering that one block in Minecraft is 1mÂ³. For real life dimensions visit [dimensions.com](https://dimensions.com).
  - If there are a range of heights, use the mean average of those heights.
- The length and width should be adjusted to keep roughly the same proportions as vanilla models.
